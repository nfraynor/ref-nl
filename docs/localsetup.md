# Local Development Guide

This document explains how to view, run, and test your basic PHP project locally.

## ‚úÖ How to Run and View the Project Locally

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure PHP is Installed

Check if PHP is installed by running:

```bash
php -v
```

If PHP is not installed:

* Install PHP (available for Windows, Mac, and Linux).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Use PHP's Built-In Server

You don't need Apache or Nginx for local development ‚Äî PHP provides a built-in server.

From your project root (where `/public/` is located), run:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

**What this does:**

* `localhost:8000` ‚Üí Starts a local server on port 8000.
* `-t public` ‚Üí Uses `/public` as the web root (so `index.php` will be found properly).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Open Your Browser

Visit:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

You should see your homepage (`index.php`), with navigation links.

‚úÖ You can now:

* View Matches
* View Referees
* Assign Referees

## ‚úÖ How to Run with Docker (Single Container with Data Persistence)

This method uses a single Dockerfile to build an image containing PHP, Apache, and MySQL. MySQL data is persisted using a Docker volume.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Docker Image

From the root of the project, run:

```bash
docker build -t ref-nl-app .
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Docker Container with Data Persistence

To run the container and persist MySQL data, use the following command. This command creates a named volume `refnl_mysql_data` (or uses an existing one) and mounts it to `/var/lib/mysql` inside the container.

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v refnl_mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql --name ref-nl-container ref-nl-app
```

**What this does:**

*   `docker run -d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
*   `-p 8080:80`: Maps port 8080 on your host machine to port 80 in the container (Apache's default port).
*   `-v refnl_mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql`: Mounts a named volume called `refnl_mysql_data` to the `/var/lib/mysql` directory in the container. This is where MySQL stores its data. If the volume doesn't exist, Docker creates it.
*   `--name ref-nl-container`: Assigns a name to the container for easier management.
*   `ref-nl-app`: The name of the image to use.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Open Your Browser

Visit:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You should see your homepage. The application and its database (with persisted data) are running inside the Docker container.

### Database Credentials

The application connects to the MySQL database running inside the same container using the following default credentials (defined in `php/config/database.php` and `entrypoint.sh`):

*   **Host:** `localhost` (within the container)
*   **Database Name:** `refnl`
*   **Username:** `refnl_user`
*   **Password:** `password` (this is the default in `entrypoint.sh` and `php/config/database.php`)

These can be overridden by setting environment variables when running the `docker run` command (e.g., `-e DB_DATABASE=my_db -e DB_USERNAME=user -e DB_PASSWORD=pass`). The `entrypoint.sh` script would need to be adjusted if you want it to use these environment variables for the initial MySQL user creation, or you would manage user creation manually after the first run. Currently, `entrypoint.sh` hardcodes 'refnl_user' and 'password' for creation.

### Managing the Container and Volume:

*   **Stop the container:** `docker stop ref-nl-container`
*   **Start the container:** `docker start ref-nl-container`
*   **Remove the container (data in `refnl_mysql_data` volume remains):** `docker rm ref-nl-container`
*   **View Docker volumes:** `docker volume ls`
*   **Remove the named volume (deletes persisted MySQL data):** `docker volume rm refnl_mysql_data` (Ensure the container using it is stopped and removed first).

## ‚úÖ (Legacy) Final Next Steps - Manual PHP Server

If you are not using Docker, follow these steps:

| Step | Action                                       |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Run `php provision.php` (ensure MySQL is running and configured as per `php/config/database.php` - you might need to update credentials from `root` with no password) |
| 2    | Run `php seed.php`                           |
| 3    | Run `php -S localhost:8000 -t public`        |
| 4    | Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser |
| 5    | Test and enjoy üöÄ                            |
