## ‚úÖ How to Run and View the Project Locally

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure PHP is Installed

Check if PHP is installed by running:

```bash
php -v
```

If PHP is not installed:

* Install PHP (available for Windows, Mac, and Linux).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Use PHP's Built-In Server

You don't need Apache or Nginx for local development ‚Äî PHP provides a built-in server.

From your project root (where `/public/` is located), run:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

**What this does:**

* `localhost:8000` ‚Üí Starts a local server on port 8000.
* `-t public` ‚Üí Uses `/public` as the web root (so `index.php` will be found properly).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Open Your Browser

Visit:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

You should see your homepage (`index.php`), with navigation links.

‚úÖ You can now:

* View Matches
* View Referees
* Assign Referees
